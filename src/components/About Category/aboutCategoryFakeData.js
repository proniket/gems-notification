    "Instead of just straight up selling items, you can spice things up by asking your customers to ‘stake’ a certain amount of tokens for that desired item. You can set the length of the time, and when that time has elapsed, they can claim the item. Alternatively you can let them set the time and with that adjust the price of the item. Check out https://bitgem.co for a great example of how this works.",

    "This is where the real fun starts. Why do so many people love slot machines? Because there is excitement in winning something without knowing what it’s going to be. And that’s the excitement our Lootboxes deliver. For a certain amount of tokens users can get one of 8, 10 or 12 NFTs, all with different rarity. It’s also possible to combine this with the Crafting pools or the Staking pools or both, the combinations are endless. ",
